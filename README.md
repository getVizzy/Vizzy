 ## About Vizzy
 Vizzy is a web platform that allows you to easily generate dynamic data visualizations so that you can gain actionable insights and communicate information quickly. After uploading data, a user can create customized graphs in just a few clicks, with the option to collaborate with others in real-time via a shared view and chat tool. Vizzy was built with Node, Express, React, Victory, Postgres, Redux, OAuth, Material-UI, Socket.io, and a dash of D3. In developing Vizzy, we learned how to dynamically render data, save user-generated graphs, and re-render them in a way that maintained their interactivity. We also gained a greater understanding of sockets and state management.
